General Info,"University at Buffalo students live and learn on three very different but complementary campuses: the North Campus, in a bustling, inner-ring suburb; the South Campus, in a historic urban neighborhood; and the Downtown Campus, in Buffalo’s dynamic medical corridor."
North Campus,"UB’s North Campus, located just outside the city in Amherst, N.Y., is where most of the university’s core academic programs are offered. Opened in the early 1970s, it is the largest of our three campuses, encompassing cutting-edge academic and research spaces, student residence halls and apartments, award-winning dining facilities, the Student Union and athletic venues. Abundant green spaces, including a recreational lake and a 65-acre living woods, complement the built environment."
General Info,"Holdings in the university archives include early manifestos of punk and original Lone Ranger radio scripts. The UB community enjoys free access to kayaks at the 60-acre lake in the middle of campus. Greiner Hall is the first residence hall in the country built in accordance with the principles of Universal Design."
South Campus,"UB’s South Campus is a Western New York landmark dating back to the 1920s. Situated in a leafy residential neighborhood in North Buffalo, the 153-acre parcel is home to classic ivy-covered buildings and grassy, tree-filled quads along with high-rise residence halls and innovative research and teaching facilities. The schools of Architecture and Planning, Dental Medicine, Nursing, Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, and Public Health and Health Professions are all located here."
South Campus,"The Abbott Library reading room houses custom woodwork from a company that helped furnish the White House. UB boasts the only museum in the country dedicated exclusively to the human brain. Historical artifacts on display in the Apothecary Museum include medicinal whiskey and asthma cigarettes."
Downtown Campus,"The pillar of our Downtown Campus is the Jacobs School of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences, which moved there in 2017 following construction of a state-of-the-art building at Main and High streets. Most of our other Downtown Campus entities—including the New York State Center of Excellence in Bioinformatics and Life Sciences, the Clinical and Research Institute on Addictions, and the Clinical and Translational Research Center—are located near the Jacobs School in Buffalo’s medical corridor, a quickly growing hub of clinical care, research and education."
Downtown Campus,"The seven-story atrium in the Jacobs School of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences building comprises over 19,000 feet of glass. The first lab in the world devoted solely to the study of cancer was established inside the UB medical school in 1898. Research projects enabled by the Center for Computational Research include everything from developing “smart bandages” to creating fairer NFL schedules."
Downtown Campus,"OUR PLACE. OUR WAY. OUR FUTURE. Address: 12 Capen Hall, Buffalo, New York 14260-1660. Phone: 716-645-2000."
