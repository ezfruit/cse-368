# cse-368
AI Project for CSE368

Our motivation for making an AI chatbot is to provide quick, instant answers and 24/7 support to users that navigate to the UB website. The UB website has many different pages that render to different groups of users. For example, a freshman who just got accepted into UB will want to navigate to the website to find information about welcome week. Since there are many pages to the UB website, it can be hard to find that information without getting lost. The chatbot will help by providing the link or directions to how to get a specific page. The reason for an AI chatbot instead of a regular chatbot is because it can be trained and be exclusive to specific types of information, such as only UB information. The more information that is fed to the bot the more accurate and helpful it will be. A regular chatbot without any NLP will not have these advantages and will have to be told exactly what to do and what to say.  We will be utilizing python as the programming language, and NLP libraries such as chatterbox, ListTrainer, Chatterbot_corpus to build the functionality of the chatbot as well as train it. We will be building a GUI using Tkinter as the user interface for the chatbot.
